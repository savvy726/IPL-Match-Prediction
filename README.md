# IPL-Match-Prediction
In the presence of dynamic and unpredictable scenario faced in T20 Cricket, this work
investigates the applicability of machine learning in prediction of IPL match winners. It
highlights the importance of historical performance and lists seven key factors that
significantly influence outcome in matches. We propose a multivariate regression-based
approach to evaluate team performance, based on probabilities of winning against
particular opponents using past results. During interval between toss and match start,
model is trained and tested for real time prediction using a variety of machine learning
models, i.e. Random Forest and Decision Tree. The models are shown to be accurate and
reliable in predicting the game and offer useful information about the game.
